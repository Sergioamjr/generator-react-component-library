## Usage

<!-- @TODO Improve -->

First, install globally Yeoman and the generator:

```
yarn global add yo generator-react-component-library
```

Of by using `npm`

```
npm install --global yo generator-react-component-library
```

Then, you're able to create a project by running:

```
yo react-component-library
```

It'll ask a few questions. Just fill them in and a folder with your project name will be created.
